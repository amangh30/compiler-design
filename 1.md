# Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)

In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions in a context-free grammar are restricted to the following forms:

- **A → BC**
- **A → a**

Where:
- **A, B, C** are non-terminal symbols (with **B** and **C** not being the start symbol).
- **a** is a terminal symbol.

## Advantages of Chomsky Normal Form

- Each production has a restricted and uniform structure.
- The derivation (parse) tree obtained from CNF is always a **binary tree**.
- A string of length **|w|** requires exactly **2|w| - 1** derivation steps.
- It enables efficient parsing using the **CYK algorithm**, making it easy to check whether a string belongs to the language.
